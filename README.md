Weather Widget

I found this assignment fun but a bit of a struggle. I used a video tutorial  to help me through it along with your module notes. I was unable to get the icons working and commented out the code if you can review it to let me know what I was missing or what was incorrect about it. I tried two ways, with the icon link as well as downloading an icon folder. Thank you for your help!
